# Acceleration

Acceleration describes how the velocity of an object changes over time. This definition can be formalized to predict how a dynamic body moves through space.

## Definition

Acceleration of a point is defined as:

$$
{}^{N}\vec{a}{}^{\,Q} \triangleq \frac{{}^{N}d {}^{N}\vec{v}{}^{\,Q}}{dt}
$$
