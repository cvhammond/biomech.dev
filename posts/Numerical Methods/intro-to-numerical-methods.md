# Introduction to Numerical Methods

These notes on numerical methods heavily reference *Numerical Methods for Engineers* [@10.5555/559180].

Numerical methods are techniques for formulating mathematical problems such that they can be solved with arithmetic operations. These methods generally involve many tedious operations that can be automated by computer processes.

## Numerical Methods Background Knowledge

Background knowledge for numerical methods includes the following:

1. Roots of Equations -> problems concerned with the value of a parameter that satisfies a single nonlinear equation; extremely useful when impossible to solve design equations explicitly.

2. Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations -> problems concerned with finding values that solve equations; find a set of values that satify a set of linear algebraic equations.

3. Optimization -> determining the values of independent variables that produce the optimal value for a function; useful for engineering design

4. Curve Fitting -> regression and interpolation; finding the curve that best represents a set of data and determining intermediate values between data points, respectively

5. Integration -> the area under a curve; including determining centroids of strange objects and solving differential equations

6. Ordinary Differential Equations -> common problems in engineering; physical systems generally follow physics based on ODEs

7. Partial Differential Equations -> differential equations related to two or more intertwined independent variables; methods include finite-difference methods and finite-element methods.
