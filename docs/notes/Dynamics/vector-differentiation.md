# Vector Differentiation

Vector differentiation is a process for finding the derivative of a vector either in the reference frame it is defined in or in another reference frame.

## Definition

For a vector $\vec{v}$ in reference frame $A$, the derivative is:

$$
\frac{{}^{A}d\vec{v}}{dt} \triangleq \frac{dv_1}{dt}\vec{a_1} + \frac{dv_2}{dt}\vec{a_2} + \frac{dv_3}{dt}\vec{a_3}
$$

### Golden Rule of Vector Differentiation

For the case where the derivative is being determined in a second reference frame, the following equation is used:

$$
\frac{{}^{A}d\vec{v}}{dt} = \frac{{}^{B}d\vec{v}}{dt} + {}^{A}\vec{\omega}{}^{\,B} \times \vec{v}
$$
