# Integer Representation

Integer representation is the traditional form of numeric storage of numbers in bit-wise fashion. It is commonly referred to in opposition of floating point representation. Specifically, integer representation uses base-2 mathematics to represent numbers.

**1**0**1**0 base-2 = 2^3 * **1** + 2^2 * 0 + 2^1 * **1** * 2^0 * 0 = 9
