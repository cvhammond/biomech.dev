# Curve Fitting

When discrete data is needed in a continuous form, curve fitting techniques can be used to approximate the data as a continuous curve. This curve can then be used to estimate other values in the state space or as part of other numerical methods.

## Basics

Curve fitting can help with the following:

- Estimating points between discrete values
- Simplify complex functions into reasonable estimates
- Approximate a function mathematically for other computations

## Approaches

1. If the data has a significant amount of error, sometimes referred to as noise, the goal is to derive a curve that provides information about the trend of the data.
2. If the data is exact and without significant error, the goal is to find a curve that runs through each data point.
