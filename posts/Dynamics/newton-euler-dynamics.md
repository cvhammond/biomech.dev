# Newton/Euler Dynamics

Newton and Euler dynamics is a form of classical dynamics for defining the motion of bodies mathematically.

## Describing Dynamic Systems

Dynamic systems can be described by one of these two equations, depending on if the system is in translational motion or rotational motion.

### Newton's Law of Motion

$$
\vec{F}^{S} = m^{S} \ast {}^{N}\vec{a}^{S_{cm}}
$$

Simply, the force applied to a system is equal to the mass times the acceleration.

### Angular Momentum Principle

$$
\vec{M}^{S/O} = \frac{{}^{N}d{}^{N}\vec{H}^{S/S_{cm}}}{dt} + {}^{O}\vec{r}^{S_{cm}} \times \frac{{}^{N}d{}^{N}\vec{L}^{S}}{dt}
$$

More complicated, the moments on system $S$ about point $O$ is equal to the derivative of the angular momentum of the system around its center of mass plus the cross product of the distance from $O$ to $S_{cm}$ and the derivative of the linear momentum.
