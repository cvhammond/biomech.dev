# Position Vectors

A point's location can be characterized by a position vector that describes the location of the point relative to some other point.

## Definition

A *position vector* is two points connected by a vector that has units of length.

The symbol ${}^{P}\vec{r}{}^{\,Q}$ indicates a position vector from point P to point Q.

Position vectors are convenient for geometry including angles, distances, area, and location.
