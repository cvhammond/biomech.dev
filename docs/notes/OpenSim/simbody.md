# Simbody

Simbody is the multibody dynamics simulation package used by OpenSim for dynamics computations. It was developed by Michael Sherman at [Simbios](http://simbios.stanford.edu/) alongside others. Historical information is available on the SimTK.org project page, as well as the [GitHub page](https://github.com/simbody/simbody)[^1]. If a class that is used in OpenSim cannot be found in the OpenSim API documentation, it is likely found in the Simbody API documentation.
