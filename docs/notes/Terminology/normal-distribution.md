# Normal Distribution

A normal distribution is a curve widely used in statistics to describe how data is distributed about a mean value.

Normal distributions can be described by $\bar{x}$ and $\sigma$ where $\bar{x}$ describes the horizontal center of the curve and $\sigma$ represents the standard deviation, or how wide the curve is.

Generally, the region bounded by $\pm 2 \sigma$ about $\bar{x}$ describes ~95% of the data within the distribution.
