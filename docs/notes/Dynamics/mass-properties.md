# Mass Properties

Mass properties are properties of a body related to its mass and inertia. These properties inform forces and dynamics related to the body.

## Mass

Mass is simply the sum of the masses of the individual bits of matter that make up the body.

## Center of Mass

The center of mass is the mass normalized average position of the small pieces of matter that make up the body. For purposes of calculations, the mass of the body placed at the center of mass of the body acts physically equivalently to mass distributed within the body.

## Moment of Inertia

Moment of inertia is a description of the momentum of a body as it moves about a center point. It is defined as:

$$
I = m \ast d^2
$$
