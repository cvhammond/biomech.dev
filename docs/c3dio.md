description: A C3d parser, writer, and editor written in Rust and available in 20 languages.

Using the [published standards](https://www.c3d.org) for the C3D file format, [c3dio](https://github.com/cvhammond/c3dio) is a library for C3D parsing and eventually editing and writing C3D files.

## Motivation

c3dio is developed on the need for a robust method of sharing, loading, saving, and interacting with both legacy and new biomechanics data. Data sharing and data processing should be a solved issue and robust libraries that facilitate C3D files are necessary to ensure easy access to biomechanical data.

## Documentation

Documentation for c3dio is available through [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/c3dio).
