# Integer Representation

Integer representation is the traditional form of numeric storage of numbers in bit-wise fashion. It is commonly referred to in opposition of floating point representation. Specifically, integer representation uses base-2 mathematics to represent numbers.

$$
1010_2 = 2{^3} * 1 + 2{^2} * 0 + 2{^1} * 1 * 2{^0} * 0 = 9_{10}
$$
