# Multiple Integrals

Multiple integrals are integrals of more than one dimensions, most commonly used for a numerical approximation of the volume under a surface.

For determining the integral a multidimensional curve, it does not actually matter the order of the integrals. For the two dimensional case, simply select points along one axis and treat each point as a curve in the other axis. Segment those curves and sum them, then sum over the other dimension and the total volume under the curve is found.
