# Numerical Integration

Integration is the opposite of differentiation and, when the mathematical representation is not available, numerical methods can be used. These processes are called numerical integration techniques.

## Understanding Integration

Mathematically, integration is represented by:

$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(x)\,dx
$$

Integration can be thought of as the *summation* of $f(x)\,dx$ for all values of $x$ from $a$ to $b$.

Graphically, integration is commonly referred to as the area under the curve, which is a convenient visual representation, but may not fully describe the phenomenon in all cases.

## Noisy Data

Integration tends to dampen the noise of data and smooth any inconsistencies out. This can be nice if you have noisy data, but does imply that data is lost during the integration process.
