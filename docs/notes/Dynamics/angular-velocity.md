# Angular Velocity

Angular velocity is the speed, in radians, of how fast something is rotating about another reference frame.

## Simple Angular Velocity

Simple angular velocity can be expressed as:

$$
{}^{A}\vec{\omega}{}^{\,B} = \pm \dot{\theta} \hat{\lambda}
$$

where $\hat{\lambda}$ is fixed in both A and B, for example, the point in which $B$ is rotating about.

## Angular Velocity Properties

Angular velocity has two important properties.

### Reversion of Angular Velocity

Angular velocity of $B$ with respect to $A$ is the opposite of the angular velocity of $A$ with respect to $B$.

$$
{}^{A}\vec{\omega}{}^{\,B} = -{}^{B}\vec{\omega}{}^{\,A}
$$

### Addition Property of Angular Velocity

$$
{}^{A}\vec{\omega}{}^{\,D} = {}^{A}\vec{\omega}{}^{\,B} + {}^{B}\vec{\omega}{}^{\,C} + {}^{C}\vec{\omega}{}^{\,D}
$$
