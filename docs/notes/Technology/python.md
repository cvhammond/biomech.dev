# Python

Python is a programming language known for its broad ecosystem and high community acceptance. Basically, if there is something implemented in another language, it's probably been ported to Python.

It is highly recommended that people with a background in engineering take the time to learn Python to improve their ability to efficiently do research and facilitate collaboration. Specifically, MATLAB stunts collaboration by paywalling access to research and code, especially for underserved communities and people who aren't actively in school.
