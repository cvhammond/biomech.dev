# Moment

Moments are the rotational corollary to forces. These values are used in modeling dynamics systems.

## Moment Calculation

A moment can be calculated as:

$$
\vec{M}^{\vec{F}^{Q}/O} \triangleq {}^{O}\vec{r}^{Q} \times \vec{F}^{Q}
$$

This equation describes a moment produces by force $\vec{F}$ applied to body $Q$ calculated about point $O$ as the cross product of the vector from $O$ to $Q$ and $\vec{F}^{Q}$.
