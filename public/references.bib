abstract = {From the Publisher:The fourth edition of Numerical Methods for Engineers offers an innovative and accessible presentation of numerical methods; the book has earned the Meriam-Wiley award which is given by the American Society for Engineering Education for the best textbook. Because computers are increasingly used as tools for numerical analysis, this eagerly anticipated revision maintains its strong computer-orientation. This edition includes sections on major software packages and libraries, and over 150 new problems.}
