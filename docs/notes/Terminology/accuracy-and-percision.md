# Accuracy and Precision

Both accuracy and precision can be used to describe a measurement and communicate different knowledge about the system or problem they are describing.

## Accuracy

Accuracy is a descriptor for how closely a computed or measured value corresponds to the *true value*.

If a thermometer reads 85.6F and the true temperature is 85.7F. Then the thermometer can be described as accurate.

The opposite of accurate is *inaccurate*.

## Precision

Precision is a descriptor for how closely a group of computed or measured values correspond to *themselves*.

Scenario: a series of readings of a thermometer measuring the temperature of the air in a room whose true temperature is not changing are recorded. The reading are all over the place, with the five values being:

- 82.3F
- 85.6F
- 81.2F
- 87.7F

These readings are *imprecise*.
