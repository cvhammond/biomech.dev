# Significant Figures

A significant figure is a concept in engineering for the purpose of communicating the reliability of a numerical value. The term significant digits refers to the digits in a measurement that can be used with confidence. Specifically, significant digits stop when the next additional value needs to be *guessed*.

## Number of Significant Digits Example

If you asked two people the temperature outside today and one said "86.3F" and the other said "86.1F", then the measurement would have two significant digits (8 and 6). Given that the two people had differing information about the thenths digit, any conclusion about the correct value would inherently be a guess.

## Exceptions to Significant Figures

Mathematically derived values such as $\pi$ or $e$ do not have a number of significant digits... until they are truncated for computational purposes. This is sometimes referred to as round-off error.
