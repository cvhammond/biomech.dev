# History of C3D

C3D was original described in the 1980s and was a subset of the ADTECH file format. At the time, the most popular programming language was... Fortran.

## The Original Purpose of C3D

C3D files were originally intended to hold the 3D motion and analog data associated with a single movement trial. It also intended to ensure that data could be read on any number of systems that researchers at different labs and facilities may be using.

Since the writing of the original C3D specification, many of the processors mentioned are no longer in production and the market has consolidated significantly. Regardless, it is imperative that C3D be written in a way that allows for data generated by any system be readable on any other system.

## How C3D Became Ubiquitous

After the original specification was finished by Douglas McGuire and Andrew Danis in 1986 and 1987, it was licensed to Oxford Metrics Ltd and put in the Vicon-VX system. As a result, every research lab who used the Vicon-VX system had data stored in C3D files. Since this system was the first on the market and widely popular, C3D became ubiquitous.
