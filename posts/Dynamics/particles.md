# Particles

In dynamics, a particle is simply a point with mass. This always particles to be described by their position, velocity and acceleration, but also by their mass in the form of momentum and kinetic energy. Particles cannot be described by their orientation in space.

## Linear Momentum of Particles

The momentum of particles can be described as:

$$
L \triangleq m \vec{v}
$$

for a given reference frame.

## Angular Momentum of Particles

Similarly, angular moment of a particle is defined as:

$$
H \triangleq r \times L
$$

For a given reference frame. Note: $L$ is [linear momentum](#linear-momentum-of-particles).

## Kinetic Energy of Particles

The kinetic energy of particles is defined as:

$$
K \triangleq \frac{1}{2} m \vec{v} \cdot \vec{v}
$$
