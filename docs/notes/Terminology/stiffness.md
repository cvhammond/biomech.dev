# Stiffness

Stiffness is a measure of how a system changes. Stiffer systems tend to have both quickly and slowing changing components.

## Definition

In a stiff system, the rapidly changing components tend to tail off as the solution is stepped through, this causes the slower components to be more significant as the steps continue. Even so, the rapid components heavily dictate the time step for the entirety of the steps.
