# Methods of Polynomial Root Finding

Polynomials are a class of equations with unique properties that can be leveraged when root finding.

## Characteristics of Polynomials

The roots of a polynomial have a few key characteristics.

1. Nth-order polynomials have N roots which can be either real or complex.
2. If complex roots exist, they exist in pairs of the form `x + yi` and `x - yi`.
3. If N is odd, there is atleast one *real* root, otherwise the previous point would be false.
