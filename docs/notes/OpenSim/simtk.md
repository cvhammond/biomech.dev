# SimTK

SimTK refers to either the website [SimTK.org](https://simtk.org) or the [Simbios](http://simbios.stanford.edu/) "**S**imulation **T**ool**K**it"[^1]. SimTK is used by Simbody, the package underlying OpenSim's multibody dynamics computations. The SimTK package defines some variables used by OpenSim including `SimTK::Vec3`.
