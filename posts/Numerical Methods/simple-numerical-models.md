# Simple Numerical Models

Simple numerical models give insight into the natural of numerical methods by generalizing and describing *a* model that can subsequently be used to create more complex and interesting models to solve novel engineering problems.

**Mathematical Models** -- Dependent Variable = Function(Independent Variables, Parameters, Forcing Functions)

## Newton's Second Law of Motion

The model representing Newton's second law of motion is one you have likely already seen:

F = m * a

## Characteristics of Models

1. Describes a natural process or system as mathematics
2. Simplifies reality by neglecting insignificant parts of the problem space or inconsequential factors.
3. Generates reproduceable results -- each time a series of inputs are put into the model, the same outputs are produced.
