# MATLAB

MATLAB is a 'programming language' developed to simplify the life of engineers who don't want to learn how to program properly. It disregards generations of common practices by computer scientists to accommodate for a mostly non-technical audience and packages open-source software behind a license and paywall.

It takes just as long to learn Python as it does MATLAB, so just ***learn Python***.

MATLAB also gatekeeps research and code by placing it behind a paywall, disproportionately affecting underserved and not-actively-enrolled students who could otherwise self-teach.
