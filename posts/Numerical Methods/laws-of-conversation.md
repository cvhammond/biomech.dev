# Laws of Conservation

There are a series of laws that are used in engineering to describe common phenomena in modeling and simulation. These areas include the following:

- Conservation of Mass (Mass Balance)
- Conservation of Momentum (Sum of forces = 0)
- Conservation of Momentum (F = m * a)
- Conservation of Charge (Current Balance)
- Conservation of Energy (Voltage Balance)

## Steady-State vs Time-Varying

During the initial phases of some phenomena, there is a time-varying or transient period where the change in the system occur quickly. In these situations, the laws of conservation can be used to predict the state of the system if some characteristics are known.

In steady-state systems, there are consistent time-independent phenomena that also follow the laws of conservation. In a steady-state case, the state of the system is more significantly determined by parameters and forcing functions than the time.
