# Force

A force is a common way of describing the interaction between bodies. Forces describe dynamics of everything from molecular forces to biomechanics to spaceships.

## Law of Action/Reaction

For each force there is an equal and opposite force applied to the other body.

## Statics

For static analysis, the assumption is that the sum of the forces of the system is zero. ($\vec{F}^{S} = \vec{0}$)

## Dynamics

For dynamic analysis, the assumption is that the sum of the forces is the mass of the system times the acceleration of the system.

$$
\vec{F}^{S} = m^{S} \ast {}^{N}\vec{a}^{S_{cm}}
$$
