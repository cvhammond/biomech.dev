# Angular Acceleration

Angular acceleration is defined as the rotational acceleration between two reference frames. Points and particles do not have angular acceleration.

## Definition

Angular acceleration is defined as:

$$
{}^{A}\vec{\alpha}{}^{\,B} \triangleq \frac{{}^{A}d {}^{A}\vec{\omega}{}^{\,B}}{dt}
$$

Additionally, using th golden rule for vector differentiation, angular acceleration can be calculated as:

$$
{}^{A}\vec{\alpha}{}^{\,B} \triangleq \frac{{}^{B}d {}^{A}\vec{\omega}{}^{\,B}}{dt}
$$

## Angular Acceleration Addition Warning

Unlike angular velocity, angular acceleration cannot be calculated simply by addition of each intermediate reference frame. Additional terms are needed to find the correct acceleration. This is the mathematical underpinning of the *Coriolis effect*.
