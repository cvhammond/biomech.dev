# Graphical Methods of Root Finding

The simplest version of root finding comes from a graphical approach. Simply plot the function and see where it overlaps with the x-axis. This approach can be robust and approachable, but is generally inefficient and requires a human to verify.

Roots visually determined by graphical methods can be checked by substituting the value of `x` into the function and seeing how close to zero `f(x)` is.
